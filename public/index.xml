      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a protein engineer at the Joint Bioenergy Institute working on the interface between synthetic biology, automation, and machine learning. I received a B.S. in chemical engineering and applied math at the University of Nevada, Reno before pursuing a PhD at the University of California, Berkeley advised by Jay Keasling. I have been generously supported by a NSF GRFP and GEM Fellowship.
Outside of the lab, I&amp;rsquo;m very into powerlifting and exploring nature.</description>
